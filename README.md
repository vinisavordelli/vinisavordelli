Hi, my name is Vinicius Savordelli (@vinisavordelli), bachelor in economics & an entrepreneur.

I am Brazilian and currently 28 y/o and I am making a big change in my professional life, I'm becoming a developer (and I'm loving it).

Currently I'm working as a part time developer at Trybe, the school I also study at. I look forward into becoming a fulltime developer and then fiding out what path I'm taking in this awesome world that software development is (although I am very interested in Data Scyence).

The course im taking at Trybe is focused in Web Development and it is divided by 4 main blocks, Fundamentals, Front-end, Back-end and Computer Science. I have just finished the second block, and I'm heading to the one I anticipated the most, the Back-end.

There are still a lot of steps to take, but I am so proud of what I've accomplished so far.

Feel free to contact me for any reason at all. You can reach me through my profile here, my LinkedIn, email (vinicius.savordelli@gmail.com) or phone (+55 (11) 98848-9449)
